# React + Vite

I used carousel for the main page
the API I used is called the Cat API, here is the link: https://developers.thecatapi.com/view-account/ylX4blBYT9FaoVd6OhvR?report=FJkYOq9tW

I also used tailwind for this assignment just because I personally prefer tailwind over CSS

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->
